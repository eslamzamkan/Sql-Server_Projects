I am very excited to share my last project about presenting the sales of pizzas and profits performance 
I analyzed the data and designed visual to improve data interpretation
Here are the steps I followed:
1. Data exploration: I identified key questions to determine performance indicators in terms of sales,profits,trend for total order
2. Data cleaning: I removed errors and missing data to ensure the accuracy of the analysis.
3. Data analysis: I used analytical tools to extract the following information using sql server and excel:
so we ask som questions on our data like:
-what is the total revnue?
-what is the average order per value?
-what is the total pizza sold*/
-what is the total orders?
-what is the average pizza per order?
-what is the daily trend for total order?
-what is the monthly trend for total order?
-what is the hourly trend per order?
-what is the sales per pizza category?
-what is the sales per pizza size?
-what is the total pizza sold per category?
-what is the 5 top sellers by total pizza sold?
-what is the bottom 5 worst sellers by total pizza? 
4. Dashboard design: I designed visual dashboards using Excel to display and analyze the data in an easy-to-understand manner.
